### Running the Software (On Local Machine)
To get the app running on your local machine you will need to download a local Apache & mySQL server. (XAMPP is good)

### Preconditions:
You have the project files downloaded and in a folder (the predefined folder will be called “calendar”) 

1. Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html and download the XAMPP utility

2. Once downloaded open the software and you should see this interface

3. Open file explorer and drop the software project folder in the directory C:\xampp\htdocs.

4. Hit start for the Apache, and MySQL Modules in Xampp, or Start them how you're used to

6. Once these interfaces are started, go to any browser and access the software via localhost.
  - Type  **localhost/calendar/index.php**  in the URL of the browser to access login page (if the path is wrong, use the directory for wherever your project is stored in the XAMPP directory on your pc)

7. The database can be accessed by typing localhost/phpmyadmin/ in the browser URL and open the “testforcalendar” database
